## 📑 About

This project was developed during [Next Level Week](https://lp.rocketseat.com.br/nlw), a week long event created by [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) to help developers reach new and exciting levels of development skills. NLW - Setup lasted from the 16th to the 20th of January 2023.

Habits is an app / website designed for you to keep track of your tasks. It can serve as both a reminder of your daily to-dos and a motivator for you to actually do them.

## 📚 What I Learned

Coming into NLW - Setup I didn't know exactly what to expect. It had been a little more than a week since I had my first contact with React and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to keep up.

In the end it worked out fine. I was able to keep up with the classes with ease and learn a lot throughout. I expanded my knowledge of React, learnt a little bit of React Native and explored new technologies like Tailwind, Expo, Vite and Prisma, which will for sure be a part of my tech stack from now on.

## 🔍 What I Did Different
