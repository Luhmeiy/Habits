## 📑 About

This project was developed during [Next Level Week](https://lp.rocketseat.com.br/nlw), a week long event created by [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) to help developers reach new and exciting levels of development skills. NLW - Setup lasted from the 16th to the 20th of January 2023.

Habits is an app / website designed for you to keep track of your tasks. It can serve as both a reminder of your daily to-dos and a motivator for you to actually do them.
